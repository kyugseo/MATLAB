# Programming:
This repository containing portfolio of data science project and scientific problem solving with programmming languages. Following projects are the example of the 
individual project. 

### Machine Learning
* [Neural Networks](https://github.com/kyugseo/Programming/blob/a6df69aff317c2c9edf8ed2ddcb530f7a247cd70/Python/Computational%20Physics/Week9_Michelle%20Moon.ipynb)

### Statistic 
* [A simplified COVID-19 model]()
* []

### Other Python project


* [Fit the AGN spectrum ](https://github.com/kyugseo/Programming/blob/899b127f69b1062454e7aea004d699fb4a18c6c3/Python/Astrophysics/fitANG.py): 
astronomical physics analyzing and fitting were done by python. 
  -	Analyzed the photometry with the calibration and calculation by using Numpy and SciPy.
  -	Handled large volumes of astronomical data sets with python library astroML.
  - Collected astronomical data such as magnitudes, object type, altitude from data sets. 
  - Made a [plot](https://github.com/kyugseo/Programming/blob/899b127f69b1062454e7aea004d699fb4a18c6c3/Python/Astrophysics/SpectrumFit_AGN.png) for the model and fitting function with Numpy and matplotlib.
