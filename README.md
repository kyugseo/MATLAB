# Programming:
This repository containing portfolio of data science project and scientific problem solving with programmming languages. 
Following projects are the example of individual projects. 

### Machine Learning
* [Neural Networks](https://github.com/kyugseo/Programming/blob/a6df69aff317c2c9edf8ed2ddcb530f7a247cd70/Python/Computational%20Physics/Week9_Michelle%20Moon.ipynb):
- looked at artificial neural networks (ANNs) for learning complex relationships
-	Adjusted to the neural net parameters, validated, and tested data sets efficiently.
-	Trained an ANN using Keras with the TensorFlow backend. 
-	Predicted the statistical analysis of the category by using Keras model.

### Statistic and mathematical project
* [A simplified COVID-19 model](https://github.com/kyugseo/Programming/blob/ea08b8d2068a8ad65f0763cf97915162696d1612/matlab/covid19analysis):

* [Linear Algebra](https://github.com/kyugseo/Programming/blob/f2137fa6affd6be102f78055b3567215c7c5b43f/Python/Computational%20Physics/Linear%20Algebra.ipynb):
- Solving a system of linear equations for some unknown variables which can be conveniently summarized in matrix.
- Community structure was built with python library networkx
- Applied this algorithm to the social interactions of a group of dolphins
- The data consist on the frequent interactions between pairs of dolphins in a pod based on their observed behaviour.


### Other Python project

* [Fit the AGN spectrum ](https://github.com/kyugseo/Programming/blob/899b127f69b1062454e7aea004d699fb4a18c6c3/Python/Astrophysics/fitANG.py): 
astronomical physics analyzing and fitting were done by python. 
  -	Analyzed the photometry with the calibration and calculation by using Numpy and SciPy.
  -	Handled large volumes of astronomical data sets with python library astroML.
  - Collected astronomical data such as magnitudes, object type, altitude from data sets. 
  - Made a [plot](https://github.com/kyugseo/Programming/blob/899b127f69b1062454e7aea004d699fb4a18c6c3/Python/Astrophysics/SpectrumFit_AGN.png) for the model and fitting function with Numpy and matplotlib.
